Running through the modules of the angular tutorial to prepare for work 

### Module 1 - Hello World! 
Module 1 demonstrates how to begin with an angular component. It should be noted that this first module assumes you've already built the angular CLI workspace but if you haven't, you'll have to create one and edit from there. There's not much about how to work on this generated workspace without pre-loaded pages and server files but there are probably work arounds I haven't yet come across.
